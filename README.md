# odin-recipes

Welcome to **Odin Recipes** — a simple HTML project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.

This project is focused on building a basic website that showcases a collection of recipes. The goal is to practice fundamental HTML skills by creating a structured page with headings, paragraphs, images, lists, and links.

## 🧾 Project Goals

- Build a basic multi-page website using **only HTML**
- Create and link separate HTML files
- Use semantic HTML elements appropriately
- Practice writing clean, readable, and well-organized code

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have:

- Learned how to structure an HTML document
- Gained experience using tags such as `<a>`, `<img>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>`
- Practiced linking pages using relative paths
- Used images from the web in an HTML context
- Improved file organization for a web project

## 📁 Files Included

- `index.html` – Home page with links to each recipe
- `lasagna.html`, `tacos.html`, `pancakes.html` – Sample recipe pages
- Folder structure that supports a growing HTML project

## 💡 Reflection

This project helped me understand the building blocks of HTML and the importance of file structure in web development. It's my first step toward building full websites and learning more advanced topics like CSS and JavaScript.
